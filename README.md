<h1>Java Development: Student and Course Management</h1>

<p><strong>Task:</strong></p>
<p>Based on the following requirements, develop the code in JAVA and deliver a fully functioning project.</p>

<p>
  Implement a class with a menu of options to: enroll students in a program, register a student for a subject in the program they are enrolled in (they should not be able to register for a subject in a program they are not enrolled in), and record the student's status at the end of the course.
</p>
<p>
  You should also be able to display the students in a program and subject (first selecting the program and then the subject within it) who are currently enrolled and those who have completed the course. In the latter case, their final status and the number of absences should also be displayed.
</p>
<p>
  The system should be initialized with 2 programs, each with a Coordinator, and 2 subjects per course for each program, each with an assigned Professor.
</p>

<h2>Detailed Task</h2>
<p>At a university, various programs are offered. These programs have a specific duration, a Coordinator, an enrollment fee, and a tuition fee.</p>
<p>
  Students enroll in these programs, but can choose to register for specific subjects. The system should track students' basic personal information, and each student is assigned an ID number by the institution.
</p>
<p>
  Subjects belong to a specific course (or year) and are taught by Professors. A Professor can teach more than one subject within a program, and may also teach subjects in other programs (e.g., Mathematics). Subjects have a name, the course they belong to, the semester they are taught in, and the Professor who teaches them.
</p>
<p>
  Professors must record the status of the students enrolled in their subject at the end of the course (Regular / Failed / Promoted). Additionally, Professors are required to register student attendance every time they hold a class.
</p>
<p>
  The system should be able to display the students enrolled in a program, as well as the students registered for a subject and their final status at the end of the course. It should also show the subjects of a program, the semester they are taught, and the Professor responsible for teaching them.
</p>

<h2>System Requirements:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2 Programs with their respective Coordinators.</li>
  <li>2 Subjects per course for each Program.</li>
  <li>Professors assigned to each Subject.</li>
  <li>Student enrollment in Programs and Subjects.</li>
  <li>Attendance records and final status of students.</li>
</ul>
